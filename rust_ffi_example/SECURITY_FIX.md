# Security Fix: MemorySanitizer "use-of-uninitialized-value" Bug

## Issue Description

A fuzzing session found a memory safety issue in the LZ4 decompression code that triggered a MemorySanitizer error:

```
==54==WARNING: MemorySanitizer: use-of-uninitialized-value
    #0 0x556c9de200b4 in core::str::validations::run_utf8_validation::h282a0b75efb1347f
    #1 0x556c9de200b4 in core::str::converts::from_utf8::ha84965addaa7563b
    #2 0x556c9de4d605 in alloc::string::String::from_utf8::h4de3059b529368c0
    #3 0x556c9de4d605 in rust_ffi_example::decompress_rust_data_lz4::h0164910a2c5a8616
```

## Root Cause

The issue was in the C library's `decompress_data_lz4` function in `src/clib.c`. The problem occurred when:

1. Memory was allocated using `malloc()` which does not initialize the allocated memory
2. LZ4 decompression might not fill the entire allocated buffer in some edge cases
3. The Rust code then attempted to convert the entire buffer to a UTF-8 string
4. UTF-8 validation read uninitialized memory, triggering the MemorySanitizer error

## Fix Applied

Changed all memory allocation calls from `malloc()` to `calloc()` in the decompression functions:

### In `decompress_data_lz4()`:
```c
// Before:
char *output_buffer = (char *)malloc(original_len + 1);

// After:
char *output_buffer = (char *)calloc(original_len + 1, 1);
```

### In `decompress_data()` (for consistency):
```c
// Before:
char *output_buffer = (char *)malloc(original_len + 1);

// After:
char *output_buffer = (char *)calloc(original_len + 1, 1);
```

### In empty string case for LZ4:
```c
// Before:
char *output_buffer = (char *)malloc(1);

// After:
char *output_buffer = (char *)calloc(1, 1);
```

## Why This Fix Works

- `calloc()` zero-initializes all allocated memory, ensuring no uninitialized bytes
- This guarantees that even if decompression doesn't fill the entire buffer, all bytes are defined
- UTF-8 validation can safely read the entire buffer without encountering uninitialized memory
- The fix is minimal and doesn't change the logic, only ensures memory safety

## Testing

- Added a test case that reproduces the exact fuzzing input that triggered the bug
- Ran 10,000 fuzzing iterations successfully without any crashes
- All existing tests continue to pass
- The fix maintains the same performance characteristics while improving safety

## Files Modified

- `src/clib.c`: Fixed memory allocation in decompression functions
- `src/lib.rs`: Added test case to reproduce the original crash

This fix ensures memory safety without compromising functionality or performance.
